"""Composite operations (ISSUE-14).

Two op classes migrated from ``_legacy.py``:

- ``FallbackOp`` — try a primary op, fall back to a sequence of ops on
  ``PerfDataNotAvailableError``. Mutates
  ``database._default_database_mode`` during the primary attempt (forces
  SILICON inside HYBRID so HYBRID doesn't silently swallow a miss with an
  empirical estimate); restores via ``finally``.
- ``OverlapOp`` — model two op groups that execute in parallel (TRT-LLM
  ``maybe_execute_in_parallel`` behavior on different CUDA streams during
  generation with CUDA Graph enabled). ``latency = max(sum_a, sum_b)``,
  ``energy = sum_a + sum_b``.

Neither op owns any CSV data — they delegate to inner ``Operation``
instances and their ``query()`` methods. No ``_data_cache``, no
``load_data``, no ``clear_cache``; the ``Operation`` base class provides
empty defaults that suffice.

    Try a primary operation first; if it raises PerfDataNotAvailableError,

    This supports transitional periods where some systems have module-level
    profiling data (single op) while others still have granular per-kernel data
    (multiple ops). The fallback is symmetric: either group can be primary.

    In HYBRID mode, the primary is queried in SILICON mode so that HYBRID does
    not silently swallow a miss with an empirical estimate — the fallback ops
    (which have real data) should be preferred over an empirical guess. In
    explicit EMPIRICAL/SOL modes, the primary respects the requested mode.

    Once the primary fails on the first call, it is skipped on all subsequent
    calls to avoid redundant work.
