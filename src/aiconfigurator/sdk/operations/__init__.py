Operations package — one file per operation family with class-owned data
loading and querying.

This package replaces the prior monolithic ``operations.py``. Migration
proceeds family-by-family (ISSUE-04 through ISSUE-14); each issue moves a
group of op classes out of ``_legacy.py`` into a dedicated file. ``_legacy.py``
is deleted by ISSUE-15 once empty.

Public surface preserves the prior import pattern:

    from aiconfigurator.sdk.operations import GEMM, ContextAttention, ...

works whether the class lives in ``_legacy.py`` or in a per-family module.
