# Introduction
Data collection is a standalone process for collecting the database for aiconfigurator. By default, you don't have to collect the data by yourself.
Small versions of database will not introduce huge perf difference. Say, you can use 1.0.0rc3 data of trtllm on h200_sxm and deploy the generated
configs with Dynamo + trtllm 1.0.0rc4 worker.

If you want to go through the process, you can try belowing commands. However, you need to prepare the env by yourself such as installing a specific trtllm version.
This process is not well verified, you need to debug sometimes.

# Preparation
Before collecting the data, make sure you own the whole node and no interfierence happens.
Next, please enable persistent-mode and lock frequency of the node. Make sure the cooling system of the node is working well.
```bash
sudo nvidia-smi -pm 1
```
```bash
sudo nvidia-smi -ac yyy,xxx
```
xxx, yyy frequency can be queried by nvidia-smi -q -i 0, refer to the Max Clocks part, xxx is SM frequency, yyy is Memory frequency.
A script to set frequency:
```
#!/bin/bash

# Run nvidia-smi query and extract SM and Memory frequencies from Max Clocks
sm_freq=$(nvidia-smi -q -i 0 | grep -A 4 "Max Clocks" | grep "SM " | grep -o "[0-9]\+ MHz" | grep -o "[0-9]\+")
mem_freq=$(nvidia-smi -q -i 0 | grep -A 4 "Max Clocks" | grep "Memory " | grep -o "[0-9]\+ MHz" | grep -o "[0-9]\+")

# Check if frequencies were successfully extracted
if [ -z "$sm_freq" ] || [ -z "$mem_freq" ]; then
    echo "Error: Could not extract SM or Memory frequency from Max Clocks."
    exit 1
fi

# Generate the command
echo "sudo nvidia-smi -ac $mem_freq,$sm_freq"
```
Prepare a clean env with the target framework and nccl lib installed.

# Collect comm data
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:${NCCL_TEST_BIN_PATH}/
network/collect_comm.sh #all_reduce data will be collected using default trtllm backend
network/collect_comm.sh --all_reduce_backend vllm #all_reduce data will be collected using vllm backend
network/collect_comm.sh --all_reduce_backend vllm --device xpu #all_reduce data will be collected using vllm backend on XPU
```
Today we only collect intra-node comm. This script will collect custom allreduce data for trtllm within a node.
It will also collect nccl allreduce, all_gather, all2all, reduce_scatter using nccl.
The generated files are nccl_perf.txt, oneccl_perf.txt, and custom_allreduce_perf.txt.

# Collector v2: model-centric cases

Collector v2 is model-centric. A healing run should collect cases for a specific
model/GPU pair, with hardware exceptions resolved by SM version, instead of
running every op bucket and hoping the support matrix improves. Use
`--model-cases-full` when you want collector v2 YAML to define a full
model-centric run. Omitting all model-case flags runs the backend registry
directly without a collector v2 case plan.

```bash
# Heal one model on one GPU type.
python3 collect.py --backend sglang \
  --model-path sgl-project/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-FP8 \
  --gpu b200_sxm

# Inspect the resolved model/SM plan without collecting.
python3 collect.py --backend sglang \
  --model-path sgl-project/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-FP8 \
  --gpu b200_sxm \
  --plan-only

# Select the architecture case file directly.
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm \
  --model-architecture Qwen3MoeForCausalLM \
  --gpu b200_sxm \
  --plan-only

# Collector v2 full run: aggregate base ops plus every model case YAML file.
# Runs only ops/cases represented in collector v2 YAML.
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm --model-cases-full

# Raw backend registry run: no collector v2 case plan.
# Runs every op registered by the backend with each collector's default cases.
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm
```

Case files:

```text
cases/base_ops/<op>.yaml             — shared common case values and op cases
cases/models/<architecture>_cases.yaml — architecture-specific all/framework op cases
cases/sm_exceptions/sm<version>_exceptions.yaml — SM-specific all/framework op exceptions
model_cases.py                       — merges base op + model + SM exceptions
```

Each model file is named after the HuggingFace architecture and lists the model
paths that should resolve to it:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
architecture: Qwen3MoeForCausalLM
model_path: Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B
model_paths:
  - Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B
  - Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B
include_base: true
```

It can include shared base op cases with `include_base: true`, then add:

```yaml
model_ops:
  - moe

all_frameworks_op_cases:
  moe:
    cases: all

framework_specific_op_cases:
  sglang:
    wideep_moe:
      cases: all
```

SM exceptions are separate and hardware-centric:

```yaml
all_frameworks_op_exceptions:
  attention_generation:
    drop: true

framework_specific_op_exceptions:
  sglang:
    wideep_moe:
      contains:
        - "tp=32"
```

Collector v2 applies those exception selectors before running an op, so known
unsupported cases are skipped instead of sent to workers. The optional
`known_exceptions` section in the same SM file is used as a runtime safety net
for failures that happen inside a collector after top-level filtering: matching
failures are logged and stored as `expected_failed` in the resume checkpoint
instead of failing the full collector run.

For simple common ops, `cases` can also contain exact generator specs. The base
GEMM sweep uses `token_counts` for the GEMM M dimension, `input_feature_sizes`
for K, and `output_feature_sizes` for N; `feature_sizes` is shorthand when K and
N use the same explicit size list. Base attention specs use `batch_sizes`,
`sequence_lengths`, `query_head_counts`, `kv_head_options`, and `head_dims`;
`kv_head_options: self` means the KV head count equals the query head count.

For targeted support-matrix healing, a case selector can run a subset using
exact `case_ids`, string `contains` matches, `indices`, `ranges`, or `limit`.
These filters are applied after the op collector generates cases for the
selected model, so every op collector gets subset support through the central
planner. Collectors that accept `model_path` receive it directly; legacy
collectors use the same value through `COLLECTOR_MODEL_PATH` while they are
being migrated.

To add a new architecture, create one `cases/models/<architecture>_cases.yaml`
file. To add a new model in an existing architecture, add the model path to that
architecture's `model_paths` list. Add shared op sweeps to the matching
`cases/base_ops/<op>.yaml` file. Add a new op collector only when the existing
ops cannot generate the needed data points. To add a new hardware exception,
create one `cases/sm_exceptions/sm<version>_exceptions.yaml` file instead of
editing every model case. `--gpu b200_sxm` resolves the SM version from
`src/aiconfigurator/systems/b200_sxm.yaml`; use `--sm 100` when collecting on an
unregistered GPU with a known SM version.

If you only want to generate `nccl_perf.txt`, use the dedicated sweep script:
```bash
export NCCL_TEST_BIN_PATH=/path/to/nccl-tests/build
bash collect_nccl_sweep.sh --output-dir /path/to/output --clean
```
The script will automatically prepend `NCCL_TEST_BIN_PATH` to `PATH`.
By default it sweeps 2/4/8 GPUs (capped by visible GPU count), the four NCCL ops, and both `half` and `int8`.

# Version Management

## Overview

Each backend (trtllm, vllm, sglang) has a **registry** (`registry.py`) that maps ops to collector modules, and a **version resolver** (`version_resolver.py`) that picks the right module at runtime. Individual collector files declare their compatibility via `__compat__`. The current collector framework versions and runtime images are declared in `framework_manifest.yaml`.

```text
framework_manifest.yaml — current collector framework versions and images
framework_manifest.py   — manifest loader/validator
model_cases.py       — collector v2 model/SM case planner
registry.py          — declares which module handles which version range
version_resolver.py  — routes runtime version → module (packaging.version)
collect.py/collect_ops — validates __compat__ and fails incompatible ops
__compat__           — per-file metadata declaring supported framework versions
cases/               — model-centric case manifests and SM exceptions
wideep/              — WideEP collector namespace for special images/runtimes
wideep/*/registry.py — WideEP-only ops appended when the v2 plan requests them
network/             — collective communication collectors and Slurm network jobs
```

WideEP entries in `framework_manifest.yaml` must keep the same framework version
as their non-WideEP framework entry. If a WideEP collector needs a special image,
put only the image override in the WideEP entry and keep the version aligned.

## File Naming Convention

- **No version fork**: `collect_{op}.py` (no suffix)
- **Version forks**: `collect_{op}_v1.py`, `collect_{op}_v2.py`, ... (sequential)
- The number is just an ordering key; the actual version range lives in `__compat__`

## `__compat__` Format

Every collector file must declare `__compat__` after the license header:

```python
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: ...
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

__compat__ = "trtllm>=1.1.0"
```

The format is `<framework><constraints>` using PEP 440-style operators:
- `"trtllm>=1.1.0"` — open-ended (latest version)
- `"trtllm>=0.21.0,<1.1.0"` — bounded range
- `"sglang>=0.5.5"` — sglang example

Pre-release ordering is respected: `1.1.0rc2 < 1.1.0 < 1.1.0.post1`.

## Registry Format

Each entry in `registry.py` is an `OpEntry` dataclass (defined in `collector/registry_types.py`).
Exactly one of `module` (unversioned) or `versions` (versioned) must be provided — this is
validated at construction time.

```python
from collector.registry_types import OpEntry, VersionRoute

# Unversioned (no fork):
OpEntry(op="gemm", module="collector.trtllm.collect_gemm", get_func="...", run_func="...")

# Versioned (has forks) — VersionRoutes in descending min_version order:
OpEntry(op="myop", get_func="...", run_func="...", versions=(
    VersionRoute("X.Y.Z", "collector.<backend>.collect_myop_v2"),
    VersionRoute("0.0.0", "collector.<backend>.collect_myop_v1"),
))
```

The resolver picks the first `VersionRoute` where `min_version <= runtime_version`.

## Adding a New Op

1. Create `collector/<backend>/collect_myop.py`
2. Add `__compat__ = "<backend>>=X.Y.Z"` after the license header
3. Export `get_myop_test_cases()` and `run_myop()` (or `run_myop_torch()`)
4. Add an entry to `collector/<backend>/registry.py`:
   ```python
   OpEntry(op="myop", module="collector.<backend>.collect_myop", get_func="get_myop_test_cases", run_func="run_myop")
   ```
5. Run `pytest tests/unit/collector/ -m unit` to verify registry integrity

## Handling a Framework API Change

When upstream framework `X.Y.Z` changes an API that a collector depends on:

1. Rename the original file to `collect_{op}_v1.py` (if not already versioned)
2. Create `collect_{op}_v2.py` with the new API calls
3. Add `__compat__ = "<backend>>=X.Y.Z"` to the new file
4. Add `__compat__` upper bound to the old file if it doesn't have one (e.g. change `">=1.1.0"` to `">=1.1.0,<X.Y.Z"`)
5. Convert the registry entry from unversioned to versioned (or prepend a new `VersionRoute`):
   ```python
   # Before (unversioned):
   OpEntry(op="gemm", module="collector.trtllm.collect_gemm", ...)

   # After (versioned — all forks carry explicit _vN suffix):
   OpEntry(op="gemm", versions=(
       VersionRoute("X.Y.Z", "collector.<backend>.collect_gemm_v2"),
       VersionRoute("0.0.0", "collector.<backend>.collect_gemm_v1"),
   ), ...)
   ```
6. Run tests to validate

## Runtime Behavior

At collection time:
1. `collect.py` reads the backend registry
2. `build_collections()` resolves each op to the correct module for the detected framework version
3. If the resolved module declares `__compat__`, it is validated against the runtime version — mismatches fail that op explicitly and are recorded in the error summary
4. Unsupported versions (no matching entry) are skipped with a warning

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/unit/collector/ -m unit
```

Covers: version parsing (PEP 440 with rc/post), `__compat__` constraint evaluation, module routing, and structural validation of all three registries.

# Collect gemm/attention/moe data/etc.

## Smoke Test

Use `--smoke` to quickly verify the collector runs end-to-end. It randomly samples 4 test cases per op instead of running the full suite.

```bash
# Smoke test for sglang
python3 collect.py --backend sglang --smoke

# Smoke a specific op
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm --ops moe --smoke
```

## Power Monitoring (Optional)

The collector supports GPU power monitoring during kernel execution using NVML. This feature is optional and disabled by default.

### Enable Power Monitoring
```bash
# Basic power monitoring
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm --measure_power

# With custom minimum duration (default: 1.0s)
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm --measure_power --power_test_duration_sec 2.0
```

### Options
- `--measure_power`: Enable NVML-based power monitoring (samples at 100ms intervals)
- `--power_test_duration_sec`: Minimum test duration for accurate power readings (default: 1.0s)

### Output
When power monitoring is enabled, performance CSV files will include additional columns:
- `power`: Average power consumption during kernel execution (Watts)
- `power_limit`: GPU power management limit (Watts)

**Example output:**
```csv
framework,version,device,op_name,kernel_source,gemm_dtype,m,n,k,latency,power,power_limit
TRTLLM,1.2.0,NVIDIA H200 SXM,gemm,torch_flow,bfloat16,1024,4096,4096,0.234,523.4,700.0
```

### Requirements
Power monitoring requires:
- `pynvml` Python package: `pip install pynvml`
- NVML support (NVIDIA drivers)

If unavailable, a warning is logged and execution continues without power data.

### Notes
- Power monitoring adds minimal overhead (<1%)
- Kernel iterations are automatically adjusted to meet minimum duration for accurate measurements
- Backward compatible: without `--measure_power`, CSVs remain unchanged

## CUDA Graph Fallback Support

The `benchmark_with_power` helper function now supports graceful fallback to eager execution when CUDA graph capture fails. This is particularly useful for complex operations like MOE (Mixture of Experts) with large batch sizes.

### Features
- **Automatic fallback**: When `allow_graph_fail=True`, CUDA graph capture failures trigger eager execution instead of raising exceptions
- **Power measurement in both paths**: Power monitoring works correctly in both graph replay and eager execution modes
- **Memory safety**: Automatic `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` call on graph capture failure to prevent memory fragmentation
- **Transparency**: Results include `used_cuda_graph` flag to indicate which execution path was used

### Usage Example
```python
from helper import benchmark_with_power

def my_kernel():
    # Your kernel code here
    moe.forward(hidden_states, logits)

# Use benchmark_with_power with fallback support
with benchmark_with_power(
    device=device,
    kernel_func=my_kernel,
    num_warmups=3,
    num_runs=6,
    repeat_n=1,
    allow_graph_fail=True,  # Enable graceful fallback
) as results:
    latency = results["latency_ms"]
    power_stats = results["power_stats"]  # Available in both paths

    # Check which execution path was used
    if not results["used_cuda_graph"]:
        print("CUDA graph capture failed, used eager execution")
```

### When to Use
- **Complex operations**: MOE, dynamic memory patterns, or operations that may not be graph-compatible
- **Large batch sizes**: When graph capture may fail due to memory constraints
- **Development/debugging**: To ensure collection continues even if graph capture fails

### Backward Compatibility
- Default behavior unchanged: `allow_graph_fail=False` maintains existing behavior
- Existing collectors work without modifications
- Only opt-in when needed for specific use cases

## For TensorRT-LLM
### Optional( Read if collecting for mxfp4 kernels)
To collect performance data for mxfp4 kernels used in GPTOSS models, depending on the version of TensorRT-LLM, you might need to manually install triton-kernels. If your version is **>= 1.3.0rc2**, nothing needs to be done and you can run the collection process directly. For any version before **1.3.0rc2**. Follow the below instructions to install triton-kernels and expose them to TensorRT-LLM
1. Build and install Triton (tested with the commit below):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/triton-lang/triton.git
cd triton
# Specific commit verified with TensorRT-LLM
git checkout f3067cd3bd0c29065fa4ecdb724b6f29cbabea5f
pip install -r python/requirements.txt # build-time dependencies
pip install wheel build
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel # if this step fails due cuda related error, you might need to set CUDA_HOME following the optional step
pip install ./dist/*.whl
```
2. (Optional) You may need to set CUDA_HOME env variable to successfully build triton
```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```
3. Expose the Triton kernels to TensorRT-LLM The kernels are not packaged in the wheel, so set the environment variable TRITON_ROOT to your Triton clone:
```bash
export TRITON_ROOT=/local/user/triton
# TensorRT-LLM expects the kernels at:
#   $TRITON_ROOT/python/triton_kernels
```
### Run collection for all available operations
```bash
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm
```
For trtllm, the whole collecting process takes about 30 gpu-hours. On 8-gpu, it takes 3-4 hours.
Please note that the whole process will report a lot of missing datapoints with errors. But it's okay. Our system is kindof robust to fair amount of missing data.
Once everything is done, you might see mutliple xxx.txt files under the same folder. Refer to src/aiconfigurator/systems/ folder to prepare the database including
how many files are needed accordingly.

## Resume Collection (Checkpoint)

Checkpoint files are always written so an interrupted run can be resumed later:

```bash
# Normal run (writes checkpoint to .collector_checkpoint/)
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm

# Resume an interrupted run (skips already-attempted tasks)
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm --resume

# Custom checkpoint directory
python3 collect.py --backend trtllm --resume --checkpoint-dir /path/to/checkpoints
```

A task is marked **done** once it is attempted (success or failure).
Only tasks that never finished are re-queued on `--resume`.
Running without `--resume` always starts fresh (overwrites old checkpoint).

## For SGLang

Suggest to start from lmsysorg docker image. Say, for 0.5.6.post2, we can use lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.6.post2-cu126
```bash
python3 collect.py --backend sglang --model-path /opt/model/DeepSeek-V3.2
```
This collects all SGLang ops in a single pass, including:
- GEMM operations (FP8, BF16, INT8, INT4)
- MLA (Multi-head Latent Attention) for context and generation
- MLA BMM (Batch Matrix Multiplication) operations
- MoE (Mixture of Experts) operations
- Normal attention operations
- WideEP / DeepSeek-specific collectors (MLA, MLP, DeepEP MoE)

### DeepEP multi-node collector
For **DeepSeek V3** models with DeepEP MoE, inter-node communication data requires a separate multi-node setup:
```bash
# Follow instructions in wideep/sglang/deepep/README.md
```
See `wideep/sglang/deepep/README.md` for complete multi-node setup instructions.

# Test
Rebuild and install the new aiconfigurator. Please make sure you have your new system definition file prepared. It's src/aiconfigurator/systems/xxx.yaml

# Validate the correctness
Today, we have limited method to validate the database. You can try tools/sanity_check to validate the database a little bit. But it highly depends on your understanding
of the GPU system and kernel optimization.

# Known Issues

## NFS File Locking (Worker Deadlock)

**Symptom**: Collection stalls after a few test cases with no error messages.

**Cause**: `fcntl.flock()` doesn't work reliably on NFS. Workers deadlock when writing to shared output files.

**Solution**: Use `/tmp/` for output files, then copy results after collection.

# Support Matrix
refer to the [**support matrix CSV**](src/aiconfigurator/systems/support_matrix.csv)
